# Mapping Freecad to Fusion 360
I have been using Fusion 360. Checking out Freecad. Here's a mapping of concepts between the two products:
| Freecad                  | Fusion 360              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| create external geometry | project lines in sketch |
| pad                      | extrude                 |
| pocket                   | cut                     |
| thickness                | shell                   |
