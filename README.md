# Comments
- If you want to create a sketch, select the face, then click on "Create sketch" from within the Tasks tab. Do not click on the "Create Sketch" from the menu bar.
- In Fusion 360, you can double click on a line that is part of a rectangle and it will select all of the lines. In Freecad it does not do that. So, there are quite a few extra clicking to select all lines, especially if there are fillets. This also adds quite a few entries in the constraints list.
- Fusion 360 has a timeline, so you can go back and edit items. Not quite sure how to do that same thing in Freecad. I see that you can edit something like a "pocket" or a "pad", but do not know how to move things around.

# Mapping Freecad to Fusion 360
Here is a mapping of concepts between the two products:
| Freecad                  | Fusion 360              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| create external geometry | project lines in sketch |
| pad                      | extrude                 |
| pocket                   | cut                     |
| thickness                | shell                   |
