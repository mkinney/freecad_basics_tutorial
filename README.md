# About
Tutorial files from the "Tutorial Books: Freecad 1.0 Basics Tutorial".

These files are not exactly based on the models in the book, as I am using inches instead of millimeters. This means I am slightly changing dimensions of the drawings.

Chapter 2: Part modeling basics: How to use "pad", "fillet", and "thickness".

# Comments
- If you want to create a sketch, select the face, then click on "Create sketch" from within the Tasks tab. Do not click on the "Create Sketch" from the menu bar.
